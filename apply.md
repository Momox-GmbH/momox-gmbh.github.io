We hire for potential not experience. If you have a bright mind and fit into our team,
we can teach you everything you need to make an impact.

What is a good team fit? You should take your work serious and not yourself.

### Application

Our hiring process consists of five simple steps:

1.  your [application](#how-to-apply)
2.  a quick [phone call](#introduction-call)
3.  a [coding challenge](#coding-challenge) (optional)
4.  [the interview](#the-interview)
5.  a [reference check](#references)

#### How to apply

You can either apply for an
[open position](https://momox-jobs.dvinci.de/en/p/english/jobs)
or write an unsolicited application.

Your application should include:

-   definitely NO cover letter
-   your CV
-   a professional or personal reference
-   relevant profiles (GitHub, Stack Overflow, LinkedIn)
-   Don’t be shy! It doesn’t matter if you don’t have everything in place.
    Just submit your application incomplete. You can always send us more later.

All applications should be submitted via our [career page](https://momox.biz/en/career/)
or via email at [recruitment@momox.biz](mailto:recruitment@momox.biz).

#### Introduction call

If we like what we see on paper, we will invite you to a quick 30-minute call. This is
your and our first chance to get to know each other. It is a casual call. You don’t have
to prepare anything. We will be explaining to you a bit more about our company and might
be asking for some missing information to complete your application.

After the call we will reassess and take a look at the code you have provided or send
you a coding challenge.

#### Coding challenge

We like looking at an applicant’s code. Should you not have any public code on GitHub or
any other project you can share with us, we might ask you to complete a small coding
challenge.

Our coding challenges are small and can be completed in less than two hours. The
challenge will be sent via email. You can submit your results and any time, but note
that your application process paused until you have completed the challenge.

#### The interview

The interview will be one and a half hours long. We usually invite you to our office if
possible. If not, we will do a Video interview instead.

You will be interviewed by our senior engineers and a recruitment manager.

The results of your coding challenge or other code/projects you have
provided previously, will serve as a loose guideline for technical discussions.

#### References

Before we make a final decision, we always like to talk to a reference. Preferably this
would be a professional reference. Any person who already had the pleasure to work with
you will do as a reference.

Should you not be able to provide a professional reference, a personal one will suffice.
