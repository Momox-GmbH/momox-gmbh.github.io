## Open-Source

### Preamble

A lot of our work builds upon open-source software other have graciously made freely
available. We believe that no matter how much you give to the open-source community you
will always receive more. We are committed to make our humble contribution wherever
possible.

### Policy

#### When should you publish your code?

Publishing the tools you are developing at Momox as open-source should be your default
mindset.

However, there are some legal constraints, information and other data you should
NOT publish:

1. Customer, user, employee or any other data covered by Art. 4 GDPR or may otherwise be
   considered private.
2. Information that could compromise the security of our systems.
3. Credentials, login or other account data.
4. Any work containing domain specific knowledge
or otherwise could be considered a company asset
or intellectual property.

You should always act in momox GmbHâ€™s best interest. If you are uncertain or feel
insecure, simply approach your supervisor.

#### How to publish code?

All public code needs to be licensed to become open source. We license all our public
work under the [The 3-Clause BSD License][bsd-3-clause].

[bsd-3-clause]: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

Our public work should follow [semantic versioning 2.0 (semver)][semver] and usually

every contribution and commit gets deployed, to make new features accessible to the

community as soon as possible.
